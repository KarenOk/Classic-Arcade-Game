# Classic Arcade Game
My rendition of the popular arcade game _Frogger_.

### How To Play
- The aim of this game is to get the player to the water as many times as you can before for the countdown stops, while also avoiding the enemy bugs.
- Use the arrow keys to move the player left, right, up or down.
- Colliding with an enemy bug resets your position.
